# How to Get Recommendation Letters

A strong recommendation letter can significantly enhance your scholarship application. Here are some tips and guidelines to help you secure effective recommendation letters.

## Choose the Right Recommenders

Selecting the right people to write your recommendation letters is crucial. Consider individuals who:
- **Know you well**: Choose people who are familiar with your academic achievements, character, and aspirations.
- **Are relevant to your field**: Preferably select recommenders who are related to the field you are applying to, such as professors, mentors, or supervisors.
- **Can provide specific examples**: Ensure they can provide concrete examples of your skills, accomplishments, and potential.

## Ask Early

Give your recommenders plenty of time to write a thorough and thoughtful letter. Aim to ask them at least 4-6 weeks before the deadline.

## Provide Necessary Information

Help your recommenders write a strong letter by providing them with the following:
- **Information about the scholarship**: Share details about the scholarship, including its purpose, criteria, and any specific points they should address.
- **Your achievements and goals**: Provide a summary of your academic achievements, extracurricular activities, career goals, and why you are applying for the scholarship.
- **Submission guidelines**: Clarify how and where to submit the letter, including deadlines and any specific formats required.

## Request in Person

Whenever possible, ask for recommendation letters in person. This allows you to discuss your request more effectively and show your appreciation.

## Follow Up

Politely follow up with your recommenders to remind them of the deadline and to see if they need any additional information. A reminder email a week before the deadline can be helpful.

## Thank Your Recommenders

After they have submitted the letter, send a thank-you note to express your gratitude for their time and effort. This not only shows your appreciation but also maintains a positive relationship for future recommendations.
